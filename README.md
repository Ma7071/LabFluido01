# LabFluido01

This repository contains experimental data and analysis plots related to fluid dynamics, specifically focusing on the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil (likely NACA 23012) at various angles of attack.

## Repository Structure

### üìÅ Data Files
- Files such as `-10_gradi.txt`, `0_gradi.txt`, `14_gradi.txt`, etc., contain pressure and wake measurements at different angles of attack (in degrees).

### üìÅ Plot Directories
- `airfoil_plots/`: Visualizations of airfoil shape and possibly streamline profiles.
- `cd_alfa_plots/`: Drag coefficient (`Cd`) versus angle of attack (`Œ±`) plots.
- `cl_alfa_plots/`: Lift coefficient (`Cl`) versus angle of attack (`Œ±`) plots.
- `cp_plots/`: Pressure coefficient (`Cp`) distributions over the airfoil surface.
- `wake_pressure_plots/`: Wake pressure profiles behind the airfoil.
- `raw_cd_data_plots/`: Raw data visualizations used for calculating drag.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Analyze aerodynamic characteristics such as lift, drag, and pressure distributions.
- Visualize how these properties change with varying angles of attack.
- Compare experimental measurements with theoretical predictions or simulations.

## Getting Started

To work with this data:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ma7071/LabFluido01.git
   cd LabFluido01
