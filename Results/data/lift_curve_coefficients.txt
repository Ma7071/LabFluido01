# Lift Curve Linear Coefficients (Cl = m·α + q) for 0° ≤ α ≤ 8°
# These coefficients represent the linear portion of the lift curve
# where the relationship between lift coefficient (Cl) and angle of attack (α) is linear.

# Experimental Data:
m_exp = 0.079322  # Lift curve slope (per degree)
q_exp = 0.348382  # Lift coefficient at zero angle of attack

# XFOIL Data:
m_xfoil = 0.090340  # Lift curve slope (per degree)
q_xfoil = 0.270851  # Lift coefficient at zero angle of attack
